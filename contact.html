	    If you would like to have the MIT Lion Dance Club perform for you, please fill out the form at the bottom of this page, <a href="https://forms.gle/EN3Maax5LRcmdWzd8"> or at the link here</a> (https://forms.gle/EN3Maax5LRcmdWzd8).
            If you are unable to fill out the Google Form, you can also send us an email at <a href="mailto:lion-dance-exec@mit.edu">lion-dance-exec@mit.edu</a>.
	    <b>Please use "[Lion Dance Performance Request] - {Event name}" as the subject of your email</b>, where {Event name} is replaced with your event name (braces not needed).
            Include your name and include information about the time and location of the performance, 
            the audience, what type of event it is, and anything else you feel is important.<br><br>
            Once received, we will contact you and make arrangements.<br><br>

            <br><b>Availability guidelines:</b><br>
            As a group of college students, we have limited availability. The following are just likely times that we
            may be able to perform. Feel free to ask us about any time you have in mind.<br><br>

            January is IAP at MIT. This is the time of greatest availability. This is the only time that we can perform
            during the daytime of the workweek.<br><br>

            Other months, we generally restrict performances between Friday evenings through Sunday evenings. February
            weekends generally become filled fastest.<br><br>

            Finally, Summer/Winter/Spring break is not a good time because most people won't be on campus. Find dates
            for these breaks at the <a href="https://registrar.mit.edu/calendar">MIT academic calendar.</a><br>
